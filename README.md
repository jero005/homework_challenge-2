# homework_challenge-2

Note: I have not tested this code file as I don't have my own jenkins server to test.

1. The DSL file is to configure the jenkins server and to create a job name called "git-secrets"
2. The Challenge_1_Trufflehog.txt is for the CI/CD pipeline with PreBuildTest, Build, PostBuildTest and Push stages.
3. I added RHEL7 os-hardening ansible yaml script.
4. The output will be saved to "results.json".
